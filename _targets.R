library(tarchetypes) # Load other packages as needed.

# Set target options:
tar_option_set(
  packages = c("tidyverse")
)

# tar_make_clustermq() is an older (pre-{crew}) way to do distributed computing
# in {targets}, and its configuration for your machine is below.
options(clustermq.scheduler = "multicore")

# tar_make_future() is an older (pre-{crew}) way to do distributed computing
# in {targets}, and its configuration for your machine is below.
# Install packages {{future}}, {{future.callr}}, and {{future.batchtools}} to allow use_targets() to configure tar_make_future() options.

# Run the R scripts in the R/ folder with your custom functions:
tar_source()
# source("other_functions.R") # Source other scripts as needed.

# Replace the target list below with your own:
